points {graphics}
=================

**Description**

points is a generic function to draw a sequence of points at the specified coordinates. The specified character(s) 
are plotted, centered at the coordinates.

**Usage**

points(x, ...)

## Default S3 method:

points(x, y = NULL, type = "p", ...)

**Arguments**

x, y - coordinate vectors of points to plot.

type - character indicating the type of plotting; actually any of the types as in plot.default.

... - Further graphical parameters may also be supplied as arguments. See ‘Details’.

**Graphical parameters commonly used are**

* pch - plotting ‘character’, i.e., symbol to use. This can either be a single character or an integer code for one 
of a 
set of graphics symbols. The full set of S symbols is available with pch = 0:18, see the examples below. (NB: R 
uses circles instead of the octagons used in S.)

Value pch = "." (equivalently pch = 46) is handled specially. It is a rectangle of side 0.01 inch (scaled by cex). 
In addition, if cex = 1 (the default), each side is at least one pixel (1/72 inch on the pdf, postscript and xfig 
devices).

For other text symbols, cex = 1 corresponds to the default fontsize of the device, often specified by an argument 
pointsize. For pch in 0:25 the default size is about 75% of the character height (see par("cin")).

* col - color code or name, see par.

* bg - background (fill) color for the open plot symbols given by pch = 21:25.

* cex - character (or symbol) expansion: a numerical vector. This works as a multiple of par("cex").

* lwd - line width for drawing symbols see par.

**Examples**

1.

.. code:: R

   plot(-4:4, -4:4, type = "n")  # setting up coord. system
   points(rnorm(200), rnorm(200), col = "red")
   points(rnorm(100)/2, rnorm(100)/2, col = "blue", cex = 1.5)
