     the active graphics window.

     ## Default S3 method:
     plot(x, y = NULL, type = "p",  xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL,
          log = "", main = NULL, sub = NULL, xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL,
          ann = par("ann"), axes = TRUE, frame.plot = axes,
          panel.first = NULL, panel.last = NULL, asp = NA,
          xgap.axis = NA, ygap.axis = NA,
          ...)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

    x, y: the ‘x’ and ‘y’ arguments provide the x and y coordinates for
          the plot.  Any reasonable way of defining the coordinates is
          acceptable.  See the function ‘xy.coords’ for details.  If
          supplied separately, they must be of the same length.

    type: 1-character string giving the type of plot desired.  The
          following values are possible, for details, see ‘plot’: ‘"p"’
          for points, ‘"l"’ for lines, ‘"b"’ for both points and lines,
          ‘"c"’ for empty points joined by lines, ‘"o"’ for overplotted
          points and lines, ‘"s"’ and ‘"S"’ for stair steps and ‘"h"’
          for histogram-like vertical lines.  Finally, ‘"n"’ does not
          produce any points or lines.

    xlim: the x limits (x1, x2) of the plot.  Note that ‘x1 > x2’ is
          allowed and leads to a ‘reversed axis’.

          The default value, ‘NULL’, indicates that the range of the
          finite values to be plotted should be used.

    ylim: the y limits of the plot.

     log: a character string which contains ‘"x"’ if the x axis is to
          be logarithmic, ‘"y"’ if the y axis is to be logarithmic and
          ‘"xy"’ or ‘"yx"’ if both axes are to be logarithmic.

    main: a main title for the plot, see also ‘title’.

     sub: a subtitle for the plot.

    xlab: a label for the x axis, defaults to a description of ‘x’.

    ylab: a label for the y axis, defaults to a description of ‘y’.

     ann: a logical value indicating whether the default annotation
          (title and x and y axis labels) should appear on the plot.

    axes: a logical value indicating whether both axes should be drawn
          on the plot.  Use graphical parameter ‘"xaxt"’ or ‘"yaxt"’ to
          suppress just one of the axes.

frame.plot: a logical indicating whether a box should be drawn around
          the plot.

panel.first: an ‘expression’ to be evaluated after the plot axes are
          set up but before any plotting takes place.  This can be
          useful for drawing background grids or scatterplot smooths.
          Note that this works by lazy evaluation: passing this
          argument from other ‘plot’ methods may well not work since it
          may be evaluated too early.

panel.last: an expression to be evaluated after plotting has taken
          place but before the axes, title and box are added.  See the
          comments about ‘panel.first’.

     asp: the y/x aspect ratio, see ‘plot.window’.

xgap.axis, ygap.axis: the x/y axis gap factors, passed as ‘gap.axis’ to
          the two ‘axis()’ calls (when ‘axes’ is true, as per default).

     ...: other graphical parameters (see ‘par’ and section ‘Details’
          below).

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Commonly used graphical parameters are:

     ‘col’ The colors for lines and points.  Multiple colors can be
          specified so that each point can be given its own color.  If
          there are fewer colors than points they are recycled in the
          standard fashion.  Lines will all be plotted in the first
          colour specified.

     ‘bg’ a vector of background colors for open plot symbols, see
          ‘points’.  Note: this is *not* the same setting as
          ‘par("bg")’.

     ‘pch’ a vector of plotting characters or symbols: see ‘points’.

     ‘cex’ a numerical vector giving the amount by which plotting
          characters and symbols should be scaled relative to the
          default.  This works as a multiple of ‘par("cex")’.  ‘NULL’
          and ‘NA’ are equivalent to ‘1.0’.  Note that this does not
          affect annotation: see below.

     ‘lty’ a vector of line types, see ‘par’.

     ‘cex.main’, ‘col.lab’, ‘font.sub’, etc settings for main- and
          sub-title and axis annotation, see ‘title’ and ‘par’.

     ‘lwd’ a vector of line widths, see ‘par’.

_N_o_t_e:

     The presence of ‘panel.first’ and ‘panel.last’ is a historical
     anomaly: default plots do not have ‘panels’, unlike e.g. ‘pairs’
     plots.  For more control, use lower-level plotting functions:
     ‘plot.default’ calls in turn some of ‘plot.new’, ‘plot.window’,
     ‘plot.xy’, ‘axis’, ‘box’ and ‘title’, and plots can be built up by
     calling these individually, or by calling ‘plot(type = "n")’ and
     adding further elements.

     The ‘plot’ generic was moved from the ‘graphics’ package to the
     ‘base’ package in R 4.0.0. It is currently re-exported from the
     ‘graphics’ namespace to allow packages importing it from there to
     continue working, but this may change in future versions of R.
