     These functions access an object's attributes.  The first form
     below returns the object's attribute list.  The replacement forms
     uses the list on the right-hand side of the assignment as the
     object's attributes (if appropriate).

_U_s_a_g_e:

     attributes(x)
     attributes(x) <- value
     mostattributes(x) <- value
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: any R object; for the replacement functions, not a ‘symbol’
          (aka ‘‘name’’) nor a ‘primitive’ function.

   value: an appropriate named ‘list’ of attributes, or ‘NULL’.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Unlike ‘attr’ it is currently not an error to set attributes on a
     ‘NULL’ object: it will first be coerced to an empty ‘list’.

     Note that some attributes (namely ‘class’, ‘comment’, ‘dim’,
     ‘dimnames’, ‘names’, ‘row.names’ and ‘tsp’) are treated specially
     and have restrictions on the values which can be set.  (Note that
     this is not true of ‘levels’ which should be set for factors via
     the ‘levels’ replacement function.)

     Attributes are not stored internally as a list and should be
     thought of as a set and not a vector, i.e, the _order_ of the
     elements of ‘attributes()’ does not matter.  This is also
     reflected by ‘identical()’'s behaviour with the default argument
     ‘attrib.as.set = TRUE’.  Attributes must have unique names (and
     ‘NA’ is taken as ‘"NA"’, not a missing value).

     Assigning attributes first removes all attributes, then sets any
     ‘dim’ attribute and then the remaining attributes in the order
     given: this ensures that setting a ‘dim’ attribute always precedes
     the ‘dimnames’ attribute.

     The ‘mostattributes’ assignment takes special care for the ‘dim’,
     ‘names’ and ‘dimnames’ attributes, and assigns them only when
     known to be valid whereas an ‘attributes’ assignment would give an
     error if any are not.  It is principally intended for arrays, and
     should be used with care on classed objects.  For example, it does
     not check that ‘row.names’ are assigned correctly for data frames.

     The names of a pairlist are not stored as attributes, but are
     reported as if they were (and can be set by the replacement form
     of ‘attributes’).

     ‘NULL’ objects cannot have attributes and attempts to assign them
     will promote the object to an empty list.

     Both assignment and replacement forms of ‘attributes’ are
     primitive functions.
