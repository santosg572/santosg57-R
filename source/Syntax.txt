     Outlines R syntax and gives the precedence of operators.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The following unary and binary operators are defined.  They are
     listed in precedence groups, from highest to lowest.

       ‘:: :::’           access variables in a namespace              
       ‘$ @’              component / slot extraction                  
       ‘[ [[’             indexing                                     
       ‘^’                exponentiation (right to left)               
       ‘- +’              unary minus and plus                         
       ‘:’                sequence operator                            
       ‘%any% |>’         special operators (including ‘%%’ and ‘%/%’) 
       ‘* /’              multiply, divide                             
       ‘+ -’              (binary) add, subtract                       
       ‘< > <= >= == !=’  ordering and comparison                      
       ‘!’                negation                                     
       ‘&  &&’            and                                          
       ‘| ||’             or                                           
       ‘~’                as in formulae                               
       ‘-> ->>’           rightwards assignment                        
       ‘<- <<-’           assignment (right to left)                   
       ‘=’                assignment (right to left)                   
       ‘?’                help (unary and binary)                      
      
     Within an expression operators of equal precedence are evaluated
     from left to right except where indicated.  (Note that ‘=’ is not
     necessarily an operator.)

     The binary operators ‘::’, ‘:::’, ‘$’ and ‘@’ require names or
     string constants on the right hand side, and the first two also
     require them on the left.

     The links in the *See Also* section cover most other aspects of
     the basic syntax.

_N_o_t_e:

     There are substantial precedence differences between R and S.  In
     particular, in S ‘?’ has the same precedence as (binary) ‘+ -’ and
     ‘& && | ||’ have equal precedence.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     ## Logical AND ("&&") has higher precedence than OR ("||"):
     TRUE || TRUE && FALSE   # is the same as
     TRUE || (TRUE && FALSE) # and different from
     (TRUE || TRUE) && FALSE
     
     ## Special operators have higher precedence than "!" (logical NOT).
     ## You can use this for %in% :
     ! 1:10 %in% c(2, 3, 5, 7) # same as !(1:10 %in% c(2, 3, 5, 7))
     ## but we strongly advise to use the "!( ... )" form in this case!
     
     
     ## '=' has lower precedence than '<-' ... so you should not mix them
     ##     (and '<-' is considered better style anyway):
     ## Not run:
     ## Consequently, this gives a ("non-catchable") error
      x <- y = 5  #->  Error in (x <- y) = 5 : ....
     ## End(Not run)
