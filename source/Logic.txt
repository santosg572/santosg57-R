     Methods can be defined for _group generic functions_.  Each group
     generic function has a number of _member_ generic functions
     associated with it.

     Methods defined for a group generic function cause the same method
     to be defined for each member of the group, but a method
     explicitly defined for a member of the group takes precedence over
     a method defined, with the same signature, for the group generic.

     The functions shown in this documentation page all reside in the
     ‘methods’ package, but the mechanism is available to any
     programmer, by calling ‘setGroupGeneric’ (provided package
     ‘methods’ is attached).

     ## S4 group generics:

     Compare(e1, e2)
     Ops(e1, e2)
     matrixOps(x, y)
     Logic(e1, e2)
     Math(x)
     Math2(x, digits)

x, y, z, e1, e2: objects.

  digits: number of digits to be used in ‘round’ or ‘signif’.

     ...: further arguments passed to or from methods.

   na.rm: logical: should missing values be removed?

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     Methods can be defined for the group generic functions by calls to
     ‘setMethod’ in the usual way.  Note that the group generic
     functions should never be called directly - a suitable error
     message will result if they are.  When metadata for a group
     generic is loaded, the methods defined become methods for the
     members of the group, but only if no method has been specified
     directly for the member function for the same signature.  The
     effect is that group generic definitions are selected before
     inherited methods but after directly specified methods.  For more
     on method selection, see ‘Methods_Details’.

     There are also S3 groups ‘Math’, ‘Ops’, ‘Summary’, ‘Complex’ and
     ‘matrixOps’, see ‘?S3groupGeneric’, with no corresponding R
     objects, but these are irrelevant for S4 group generic functions.

     The members of the group defined by a particular generic can be
     obtained by calling ‘getGroupMembers’. For the group generic
     functions currently defined in this package the members are as
     follows:

     ‘Arith’ ‘"+"’, ‘"-"’, ‘"*"’, ‘"^"’, ‘"%%"’, ‘"%/%"’, ‘"/"’

     ‘Compare’ ‘"=="’, ‘">"’, ‘"<"’, ‘"!="’, ‘"<="’, ‘">="’

     ‘Logic’ ‘"&"’, ‘"|"’.

     ‘Ops’ ‘"Arith"’, ‘"Compare"’, ‘"Logic"’

     ‘Math’ ‘"abs"’, ‘"sign"’, ‘"sqrt"’, ‘"ceiling"’, ‘"floor"’,
          ‘"trunc"’, ‘"cummax"’, ‘"cummin"’, ‘"cumprod"’, ‘"cumsum"’,
          ‘"log"’, ‘"log10"’, ‘"log2"’, ‘"log1p"’, ‘"acos"’, ‘"acosh"’,
          ‘"asin"’, ‘"asinh"’, ‘"atan"’, ‘"atanh"’, ‘"exp"’, ‘"expm1"’,
          ‘"cos"’, ‘"cosh"’, ‘"cospi"’, ‘"sin"’, ‘"sinh"’, ‘"sinpi"’,
          ‘"tan"’, ‘"tanh"’, ‘"tanpi"’, ‘"gamma"’, ‘"lgamma"’,
          ‘"digamma"’, ‘"trigamma"’

     ‘Math2’ ‘"round"’, ‘"signif"’

     ‘Summary’ ‘"max"’, ‘"min"’, ‘"range"’, ‘"prod"’, ‘"sum"’, ‘"any"’,
          ‘"all"’

     ‘Complex’ ‘"Arg"’, ‘"Conj"’, ‘"Im"’, ‘"Mod"’, ‘"Re"’

     ‘matrixOps’ ‘"%*%"’

     Note that ‘Ops’ merely consists of three sub groups.

     All the functions in these groups (other than the group generics
     themselves) are basic functions in R.  They are not by default S4
     generic functions, and many of them are defined as primitives.
     However, you can still define formal methods for them, both
     individually and via the group generics.  It all works more or
     less as you might expect, admittedly via a bit of trickery in the
     background.  See Methods_Details for details.

     Note that two members of the ‘Math’ group, ‘log’ and ‘trunc’, have
     ... as an extra formal argument.  Since methods for ‘Math’ will
     have only one formal argument, you must set a specific method for
     these functions in order to call them with the extra argument(s).

     For further details about group generic functions see section 10.5
     of the second reference.

     The function ‘callGeneric’ is nearly always relevant when writing
     a method for a group generic.  See the examples below and in
     section 10.5 of _Software for Data Analysis_.
